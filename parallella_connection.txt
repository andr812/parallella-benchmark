You can both do it by git cloning.

<Epiphany Esdk on Linux Systems>
Download it here

In my board, I installed Epiphany SDK for ARMv7 platform
latest release is 2016.03
https://github.com/adapteva/epiphany-sdk/tree/2016.3
You have to download prerequisites before installing.
If you get 
Building tool chain...
ERROR: Tool chain build for host machine failed.
There are several methods to fix it.
1. Prerequisites may not be installed properly. Try again.
2. follow this site
https://github.com/adapteva/epiphany-sdk/issues/70
3. Check if the guile is installed if not
sudo apt-get install guile-1.8
4. If doesn't work

<Parsec benchmark program>
1. Download it in http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/
(I recommand 3.0 version)
2. Since it is heavy program it might take a while to download it.
( There is no binary file that is suitable to Epiphany, so just download the whole file and compile it.)
